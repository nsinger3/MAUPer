For my master's degree, I did this project. I did a course-based / masters-research-project grad program, so my research / writing / time was spent developing MAUPer.

The purpose of the tool is to visualize how the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem manifests at differing geographic scales. To do so, it employs demographic information from the 2021 Canadian Census and Polluting Facility data from Canada's NPRI.

This project uses:
  - Node.js + express.js (https://expressjs.com/)
  - Leaflet.js (https://leafletjs.com/)
  - PostgreSQL + PostGIS Plugin (https://postgis.net/)
  - Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/)
  - Chart.js (https://www.chartjs.org/)
